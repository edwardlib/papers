Title:
Deep Probabilistic Programming: Edward and TensorFlow Distributions

Abstract:
The Edward and TensorFlow Distribution libraries implement a vision of
probability theory adapted to the modern deep-learning paradigm of
end-to-end differentiable computation. In this talk, we will provide
an overview of Edward, a probabilistic programming system built on
computational graphs, as well as an overview of TensorFlow
Distributions, an efficient backend for building and manipulating
probability distributions. In particular we will show how Edward and
TensorFlow Distributions can be applied for expanding the frontier of
deep generative models and variational inference.
